# Hi, I'm Anand👋

Engineer obsessed with building systems that don’t fall apart when they hit real traffic. I focus on backend engineering, distributed architectures, and scalable service design. Every project I build aims to look, feel, and behave like production-grade software — clean abstractions, predictable behavior, observable internals, and performance that holds under pressure.

I treat backend work like a craft: efficient JVM tuning, resilient microservices, data models that age well, and real-time systems that behave reliably when multiple users collide. Recruiters looking for engineers who think in systems, not snippets — you’re in the right place.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

### **Backend Engineering**

* **Java** (Core Java, collections, concurrency fundamentals, JVM behavior)
* **Spring Boot** (spring-web, spring-data, spring-security, actuator, validation)
* **Spring Cloud & Microservices** (Eureka, Gateway, Config Server, OpenFeign, Resilience4j)
* **Spring AI** (prompting, model integrations, adapters for LLM-based features)
* **RESTful Architectures** (request lifecycle, error design, serialization strategies)

### **Systems & Infrastructure**

* **Docker** (containerization, multistage builds, small and efficient images)
* **Kubernetes (learning in progress)** (scaling, service mesh basics, observing microservice orchestration)
* **CI/CD** (GitHub Actions; soon diving into MLOps + system design)

### **Databases & Messaging**

* **SQL** (MySQL, PostgreSQL – indexing strategies, query optimization, transactions)
* **NoSQL** (MongoDB – schema design, aggregation, high‑throughput patterns)
* **Redis** (caching strategies, pub/sub, distributed locks)
* **Kafka (beginner)** (event-driven fundamentals)

### **Frontend (Collaborative tools + internal projects)**

* **React** (component logic, client-side state basics)
* **TypeScript** (cleaner interfaces, predictable behaviors)

### **Other Tools & Skills**

* **Git & GitHub** (branching discipline, clean commit practice)
* **WebSockets** (real-time communication)
* **Authentication & Authorization** (JWT, role-based security)
* **Understanding of distributed system patterns** (circuit breakers, service discovery, load balancing, consistency models)

## 🧠 What I Love Building

I'm deeply interested in **distributed systems**—not the buzzword flavor, but the real engineering side: how services discover each other, how data stays consistent across nodes, how failure is handled gracefully, how scalability is designed instead of hoped for.

I actively explore:

* fault‑tolerance patterns
* domain-driven design foundations
* high availability strategies
* real‑time collaboration mechanisms
* integrations between backend architecture and modern AI systems

## 🔥 Major Projects

### **1. Real‑Time Collaborative Code Editor**

A fully synchronized, low‑latency collaborative editor supporting multiple users typing in real time.

* Built with **Spring Boot**, **WebSockets**, **STOMP**, and **React**
* Operational transformation/CRDT‑inspired syncing model
* Multi-user cursor tracking, conflict resolution, and event-driven updates
* Optimized for minimal bandwidth usage and smooth user experience

### **2. Microservices E‑commerce Platform with Payment Gateway Integration**

A production-style ecommerce architecture designed around clean modularity and resilient distributed communication.

* **Microservice stack:** User Service, Product Service, Inventory Service, Payment Service, Order Service
* **Spring Cloud** for service discovery, load balancing, config management
* **Resilience4j** for retries, fallbacks, circuit breakers
* **Payment gateway integration** (UPI/Card style flow simulation)
* **MongoDB + MySQL mix** for polyglot storage
* **API Gateway** with rate limiting & authentication

### **3. AI-Powered Application Using Gemini API + Spring AI**

A practical AI project integrating LLM capabilities into backend workflows.

* Uses **Gemini free API key** with **Spring AI**
* Prompt engineering with templating
* Structured output bindings (JSON responses mapped directly to domain objects)
* Use-cases: smart suggestions, semantic search components, and knowledge extraction endpoints

## 🌱 Minor Projects

### **Chat Application (WebSockets + Spring)**

A clean, event-driven real-time chat app supporting rooms, presence detection, and user-status broadcasting.

### **Task Scheduler + Worker System**

Backend service that schedules and distributes background jobs using queued workers.

### **URL Shortener with Analytics**

A compact system using Redis and MongoDB to offer short links with click tracking, device metadata logging, and expiring tokens.

### **System Health Monitor**

A Spring Boot service that exposes real-time server health metrics using Actuator + custom health indicators.

## 🎯 What I'm Actively Improving

* Advanced concurrency patterns in Java
* Robust system design principles
* MLOps workflows (model lifecycle + CI/CD for AI features)
* Cloud-native thinking (scaling, observability, distributed tracing)
* Social energy, communication, and leadership abilities inside engineering teams
