#*Hi , I am Anand👋**
  
Computer Science student building production-grade distributed systems. Focused on backend architecture, real-time systems, and scalable infrastructure.

##🚀** What I'm Building**

_CodePair - Distributed Real-Time Collaborative Code Editor_
A production-ready system handling 1000+ concurrent users with microservices architecture, achieving sub-50ms P95 latency for code synchronization.
Tech Stack: Spring Boot, Apache Kafka, Redis, WebSocket, PostgreSQL, Docker
Architecture: 7 microservices | Event-driven | Horizontal scaling | Fault-tolerant

_E-Commerce Platform - Microservices-Based Shopping Platform_
Full-stack e-commerce system with integrated payment gateway, Redis caching for high-traffic endpoints, and secure authentication.
Tech Stack: Spring Boot, Spring Security, Redis, PostgreSQL, Payment Gateway Integration
Features: JWT Authentication | Request Caching | Transaction Management | Low Latency (cached endpoints)

##**💻 Technical Focus**

Backend & Infrastructure:
Spring Boot • Kafka • Redis • PostgreSQL • Docker • Microservices
Currently Learning:
System Design • Distributed Systems • Computer Networks • WebSocket Protocol
Exploring:
